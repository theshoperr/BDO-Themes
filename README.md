# BDO-Themes

For anyone reading this, before start thinking that "oh, he has some codes that are from other people and he uses for donators..." no. The code I have on "donators" folder
is indeed from other people...Most of it. Some codes are inspired (hence why its so similar) but others are really a copy. But the "donators" thing I have, is not real, not
for real donators, I don't take money. It's for fun purpose only, to use with friends and close people.

Some of my themes have similar css and other people's snippets, but that is normal. Most of the code is made by me. That doesn't apply to my old themes like Galactus and Levian.
Those themes I won't be posting anywhere. But the others are original.
